# Implementing WebSocket-based Communication Service

## Introduction
In this guide, we'll walk through the process of implementing a WebSocket-based communication service to facilitate messaging between brands and influencers on our platform. This service will allow real-time communication, enabling brands to send requests to influencers, influencers to accept or reject requests, and both parties to communicate through a message box.

## Issues Bifurcation
We'll break down the implementation process into several key issues:

1. Setting Up WebSocket Server
   - Initialize a WebSocket server using Node.js and Express.
   - Implement WebSocket endpoints for handling connections, disconnections, and messages.

2. Integrating WebSocket Server with Backend
   - Connect the WebSocket server with your existing Node.js backend.
   - Implement logic to authenticate and authorize users (brands and influencers) for WebSocket connections.

3. Implementing Frontend WebSocket Client
   - Set up WebSocket connections from the frontend using a WebSocket client library (e.g., Socket.io).
   - Implement client-side logic to handle WebSocket events such as connecting, disconnecting, and receiving messages.

4. Implementing Request Sending and Acceptance Flow
   - Design UI components and backend APIs for brands to send requests and influencers to accept or reject them.
   - Integrate WebSocket communication to notify users about new requests and their status updates in real-time.

5. Implementing Messaging Feature
   - Design UI components for the messaging interface between brands and influencers.
   - Implement backend APIs to handle sending and receiving messages.
   - Integrate WebSocket communication to enable real-time messaging updates.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Setting Up WebSocket Server
   - Create a new WebSocket server using the WebSocket library in Node.js.
   - Define WebSocket routes for handling different events (connection, message, disconnection).

### 2. Integrating WebSocket Server with Backend
   - Modify your existing backend to support WebSocket connections.
   - Implement authentication middleware to verify WebSocket connection requests.
   - Ensure WebSocket connections are associated with authenticated users.

### 3. Implementing Frontend WebSocket Client
   - Install a WebSocket client library (e.g., Socket.io) in your frontend project.
   - Set up WebSocket connections in your frontend code to connect to the WebSocket server.
   - Implement event listeners to handle WebSocket events (connect, disconnect, message).

### 4. Implementing Request Sending and Acceptance Flow
   - Design UI components for brands to send requests and influencers to accept or reject them.
   - Implement backend APIs to handle request sending, acceptance, and rejection.
   - Integrate WebSocket communication to update users in real-time about request status changes.

### 5. Implementing Messaging Feature
   - Design UI components for the messaging interface between brands and influencers.
   - Implement backend APIs for sending and receiving messages.
   - Integrate WebSocket communication to enable real-time messaging updates.

## Conclusion
By following this guide and addressing each of the outlined issues, we will be able to implement a WebSocket-based communication service for our platform, enabling real-time messaging between brands and influencers.
